# youtube-abuse-proof-of-concept
ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜® Proof of concept for some serious abuse of YouTube, potentially with no code required.

## Theory

I think I have found a potential method of abusing YouTube without any code whatsoever. I can't help but be involved in so many things out of interest, and I just spotted something that was completely unrelated to what I was doing at the time, and I had to look further into it, and sure enough I think I am onto something significant.

I build, maintain, and support a lot of websites, a lot of them for free just because I like doing it, they are good people that deserve the help, and absolutely wouldn't be able to afford it themselves otherwise, and I get to work on a LOT of real projects, and in scenarios that I else wouldn't otherwise be anywhere near.

I installed the YouTube studio application just to play around with it because that's what I do for some reason. I find something, and press every single button available if its a GUI, or try every function if it is a CLI tool, or API. Out of lazyness I host a bunch of videos on YouTube, and also because a lot of my work is also on the platform, under the names of other people that I have done the work for.
