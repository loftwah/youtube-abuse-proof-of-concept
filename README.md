ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜® Proof of concept for some serious abuse of YouTube, potentially with no code required.

## Theory

I think I have found a potential method of abusing YouTube without any code whatsoever. I can't help but be involved in so many things out of interest, and I just spotted something that was completely unrelated to what I was doing at the time, and I had to look further into it, and sure enough I think I am onto something significant.

I build, maintain, and support a lot of websites, a lot of them for free just because I like doing it, they are good people that deserve the help, and absolutely wouldn't be able to afford it themselves otherwise, and I get to work on a LOT of real projects, and in scenarios that I else wouldn't otherwise be anywhere near.

I installed the YouTube studio application just to play around with it because that's what I do for some reason. I find something, and press every single button available if its a GUI, or try every function if it is a CLI tool, or API. Out of lazyness I host a bunch of videos on YouTube, and also because a lot of my work is also on the platform, under the names of other people that I have done the work for.

I'm a bit tired to keep doing this tonight, but will continue.

This is going to be pretty cool, and I'm not sure if there is anything they can do about it, or it is possible that they already know about it.
